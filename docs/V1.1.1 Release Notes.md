## 1.1.1 Release Notes

### **Release Notes: Data Federation Resource API V1.1.1**

The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is excited to announce the
release of version 1.1.1 of the [Data Federation Resource API](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api-aggregation).

**API Overview**

The Data Federation Resource API enables users to search data from
various resources as if querying a single virtual database. Data remains
in its original location and is not moved or centrally warehoused,
allowing users to access it directly where it resides. Data access
processes adhere to the policies of each contributing resource.

V1.1.1 update enhances the API's functionality by:

- Introducing integration with the [Childhood Cancer Data Initiative
  (CCDI) Participant Index (CPI) Service](https://ccdi.cancer.gov/ccdi-participant-index )

- Adding Childhood Cancer Catalog of [Circular Extrachromosomal DNA
  (eCDNA)](https://ccdi-ecdna.org) as a node in the Federation. The
  ecDNA Portal is a comprehensive catalog of circular extrachromosomal
  DNA (ecDNA) associated with childhood cancers, facilitating research
  and clinical insights.

Additional members include the Kids First Data Resource Center,
Pediatric Cancer Data Commons, St. Jude Cloud, and Treehouse Childhood
Cancer Data Initiative. These resources provide information on genomic,
clinical, imaging, and biospecimen data. The list of participating
organizations will continue to grow as more contributors implement
CCDI's federation data API.

**Federation Integration with the CCDI Participant Index Service**

The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Participant Index (CPI) maps
research participant identifiers across multiple studies and
institutions, collectively referred to as "Domains". This mapping
capability enhances the discovery of multimodal data, facilitating the
exploration of complex research questions, and ultimately supporting the
development of innovative therapies for pediatric cancers.

Through //Subject_mapping the CPI finds the subjects known by the
Federation and returns domain ID/ID pairs and all mapped organizational
domain ID/ID pairs for each found subject ID.

Additional information related to the CPI can be found in the [CPI
Participant index Documentation Site](https://participantindex-docs.ccdi.cancer.gov).

**Childhood Cancer Catalog of Circular Extrachromosomal DNA (eCDNA)**

The eCDNA is the first member of the CCDI Data Federation to adopt the
already developed [specification](https://ccdi-ecdna.org/ccdi-federation-api-documentation).

**Harmonized Data**

Metadata has been harmonized to Common Data Elements (CDEs) to
standardize attributes and allowable values and are registered in the
[Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR)](https://cadsr.cancer.gov).

- Age data: Some values have been converted from years to days and
  should not be interpreted as exact values.

- Diagnosis values: incorporate terms from various classifications (CNS
  Diagnosis Category, ICD-0 3.2, and WHO CNS5), leveraging [Uberon
  ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon).

- Harmonized diagnosis values provided by Federation members may not
  always perfectly align with the original data. Users are advised to
  review unharmonized values or contact the respective data provider for
  additional clarification.
