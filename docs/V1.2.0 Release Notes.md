# Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) Data Federation Resource

## 1.2 Release Notes

### **Release Notes: Data Federation Resource API V1.2**

The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is excited to announce the
release of version 1.2.0 of the [Data Federation Resource API](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api-aggregation).

**API Overview**

The Data Federation Resource API enables users to search data from
various resources as if querying a single virtual database. Data remains
in its original location and is not moved or centrally warehoused,
allowing users to access it directly where it resides. Data access
processes adhere to the policies of each contributing resource.

V1.2 update enhances the API's functionality:

- Adding new and updated harmonized metadata

  - Add **associated_diagnosis field** to subject endpoint

  - **Age at Vital Status**: update retired CDE
    [[14480965]{.underline}](https://cadsr.cancer.gov/onedata/dmdirect/NIH/NCI/CO/CDEDD?filter=CDEDD.ITEM_ID=14480965%20and%20ver_nr=1)
    with new CDE
    [[12306025]{.underline}](https://cadsr.cancer.gov/onedata/dmdirect/NIH/NCI/CO/CDEDD?filter=CDEDD.ITEM_ID=12306025%20and%20ver_nr=1)

  - **Sample Tumor Status:** updated retired CDE
    [5432687](https://cadsr.cancer.gov/onedata/dmdirect/NIH/NCI/CO/CDEDD?filter=CDEDD.ITEM_ID=5432687%20and%20ver_nr=2)
    with new CDE
    [14688604](https://cadsr.cancer.gov/onedata/dmdirect/NIH/NCI/CO/CDEDD?filter=CDEDD.ITEM_ID=14688604%20and%20ver_nr=1)

  - **Sample ID**: Add CDE
    [15100774](https://cadsr.cancer.gov/onedata/dmdirect/NIH/NCI/CO/CDEDD?filter=CDEDD.ITEM_ID=15100774%20and%20ver_nr=1)
    to sample identifier endpoint

  - **Tumor Grade**: Implement Tumor Grade CDE
    [11325685](https://cadsr.cancer.gov/onedata/dmdirect/NIH/NCI/CO/CDEDD?filter=CDEDD.ITEM_ID=11325685%20and%20ver_nr=2)
    at the /sample level

- Implementing search endpoints to support using case-insensitive
  substring matching to support improved disease at diagnosis querying

  - Add **sample-diagnosis endpoint**

  - Add **subject-diagnosis endpoint**

The API includes data from the Kids First Data Resource Center,
Pediatric Cancer Data Commons, St. Jude Cloud, Treehouse Childhood
Cancer Data Initiative and the Childhood Cancer Catalog of Circular
Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). These resources provide information on
genomic, clinical, imaging, and biospecimen data. The list of
participating organizations will continue to grow as more contributors
implement CCDI's federation data API.

**Harmonized Data**

Metadata has been harmonized to Common Data Elements (CDEs) to
standardize attributes and allowable values and are registered in the
Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR)
([https://cadsr.cancer.gov](https://cadsr.cancer.gov)).

- Age data: Some values have been converted from years to days and
  should not be interpreted as exact values.

- Diagnosis values: incorporate terms from various classifications (CNS
  Diagnosis Category, ICD-0 3.2, and WHO CNS5), leveraging [Uberon
  ontology](<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon>).

- Harmonized diagnosis values provided by Federation members may not
  always perfectly align with the original data. Users are advised to
  review unharmonized values or contact the respective data provider for
  additional clarification.

**Updated for V1.2**

**Filtered Search Capabilities**

V1.2 includes support for filtered searches across harmonized fields.
Support varies among participating nodes. The table below provides an
overview of the filter criteria supported by each participating
resource.
