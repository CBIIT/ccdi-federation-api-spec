## About CCDI Data Federation Resource
Data federation enables users to pull data from across various resources as if they were accessing a single virtual database, rather than consolidating all data into a single centralized repository. The data remain at the original source but become searchable and findable to the research community through a standard application programming interface (API). This allows the creation of a virtual cohort and facilitates large-scale analytic research by making deidentified participant-level data (non-PHI/PII) findable across the sources.

The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) is piloting data federation with Kids First Data Resource Center, the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons, St. Jude Cloud, and the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. These resources provide information about genomic, clinical, imaging, and biospecimen data in these data sets. This list will expand as more organizations implement CCDI’s data federation API.

## Data Access
Researchers can search for deidentified individual-level data through the API, which provides metadata that aids in the creation of virtual cohorts across multiple data types from participating resources by accessing CCDI's federation API.

To access the CCDI’s data federation API, please [click here](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/).

To access specific resource nodes, please [click here](https://cbiit.github.io/ccdi-federation-api/).

The API does not deliver files. Rather, it provides an open-access subset of the metadata (e.g., demographics) that match a user’s search criteria and provides the location of the complete data set. The data are accessible according to the policies at each contributing resource.

## Additional Available Resources
The CCDI Data Federation Resource offers a suite of resources including the OpenAPI Specification, Data Dictionaries, and comprehensive documentation on the CCDI Data Federation Resource GitHub Repository. You may also get assistance or report an issue.

## Contribute to CCDI Data Federation Resource
We invite the community to join us in empowering research through CCDI data federation. Organizations that implement CCDI’s data federation API harmonize data according to CCDI standards to ensure data are searchable.

Details can be found on the CCDI Data Federation Resource [Wiki page](https://github.com/jpat1546/ccdi-federation-api-spec/wiki)
